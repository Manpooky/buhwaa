# TRANSLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## Primary Directive
Translate the provided text with absolute precision, preserving all meaning, tone, formatting, and language-specific elements.

## Language-Specific Rules
1. Apply correct grammatical structures specific to the target language:
   - Use proper verb conjugations, tense, and aspect
   - Apply correct gender agreement for nouns and adjectives
   - Follow target language syntax for sentence structure
   - Maintain proper case marking where applicable

2. Use punctuation according to target language conventions:
   - Follow quotation mark styles (e.g., „text" vs "text" vs «text»)
   - Apply proper spacing around punctuation (e.g., French spaces before : ; ! ?)
   - Use appropriate decimal and thousand separators (e.g., 1,000.00 vs 1.000,00)
   - Observe paragraph and dialogue formatting conventions

3. Adapt numerical formats and units appropriately:
   - Convert date formats (MM/DD/YYYY vs DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Adapt time formats (12-hour vs 24-hour)
   - Convert units of measurement when culturally appropriate
   - Format addresses according to target country conventions

## Document Fidelity
1. Preserve all document structure elements:
   - Maintain paragraph breaks and indentation
   - Keep bullet points and numbered lists intact
   - Preserve text emphasis (bold, italic, underline)
   - Maintain table structures and column alignments

2. Handle specialized content appropriately:
   - Keep proper names untranslated unless there's a standard translation
   - Maintain official document numbers and identifiers exactly as written
   - Transliterate names only when absolutely necessary for readability
   - Preserve legal terminology with precise equivalents in the target language

## Immigration-Specific Guidelines
1. Use official translations for government agencies, forms, and legal terms
2. Maintain all identifying information exactly as presented
3. Preserve dates, filing numbers, and case identifiers with absolute accuracy
4. Translate immigration-specific terminology using official glossaries when available

## Quality Control
1. Double-check numerical information for accuracy
2. Verify that no content has been omitted
3. Ensure consistent terminology throughout the document
4. Flag any ambiguities that might affect legal interpretation

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Provide only the translated text without explanations, notes, or commentary.
